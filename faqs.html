            <h1>FAQs:</h1>
            <p>Q: Is Banff kid-friendly?</p>
            <p>A: Of course! While some of our trails are lengthier than others, it is ultimately your decision
              on how strenuous you want your experience to be. Plenty of families visit Banff and have had great
              experiences. However, do note that some activities such as canoeing will have age restrictions.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Q: When is peak season?</p>
            <p>A: Peak season typically begins in June and ends around late August. However, do not feel as though 
              this is the only time to visit. While during our off-seasons, the weather is typically cold, the winter 
              sights provide their own special charm.
            </p>
            
            <br>
            <p>Q: How long should I stay in Banff?</p>
            <p>A: Although this is probably not answer you'd like to hear, it truly depends! Depending on the time you have 
              available, your interests, and other factors, each person is recommended to tailor their experiences to themselves.
              Most visitors stay ~5 days to truly grasp the full experience, while those more pressed for time might only stay 2
              days to see our world-renowned lakes.

            <p>Q: Who took these lovely photos on your website?</p>
            <p>A: We're glad you asked! The ski lift picture seen on our donate page comes from Pursuit Collection, the photo of 
              Lake Moraine on our homepage comes from Rowan Sims Photography, our photo demonstrating Canada Day comes from Encylopedia
              Britannica, the photo from our about page comes from the Fairmont Springs Hotel, and the photo on this page comes from 
              Max Stussi/Adventure Cities.
