            <h1>About:</h1>
            <p>Visitors to Banff can explore a wide range of outdoor activities throughout the year, including hiking, 
              skiing, snowboarding, mountain biking, and wildlife viewing. Iconic attractions such as Lake Louise, 
              Moraine Lake, and the Banff Gondola offer unforgettable experiences and picture-perfect vistas.</p>
            
            <p>In addition to the natural wonders, we also boast a vibrant town center filled with boutique shops, 
              art galleries, cozy cafes, and world-class restaurants. Whether strolling along Banff Avenue, relaxing 
              in the Banff Upper Hot Springs, or immersing oneself in the rich history and culture of the area at the Whyte 
              Museum of the Canadian Rockies, there is no shortage of things to see and do in Banff. With its awe-inspiring 
              scenery and endless opportunities for adventure, we hope to captivate the hearts of travelers from around the globe.</p>
            
            <p>In Banff, every moment is an opportunity for discovery, every vista a testament to the enduring power of nature.
               Whether seeking adventure in the great outdoors or solace in the tranquility of the mountains, Banff offers a sanctuary
                for the soulâ€”a place where wonder knows no bounds, and the spirit of the wild runs free.</p>
  
            <p>We stand as a beacon of conservation and environmental stewardship, committed to preserving our natural treasures 
              for generations to come. Through a combination of rigorous management practices, innovative conservation initiatives, 
              and community engagement, Banff tries to exemplify the delicate balance between human activity and the protection of 
              our fragile ecosystems.</p>

            <p>One of the cornerstones of our conservation efforts is wildlife management. With a diverse array of species calling 
              this park home (including but not limited to: grizzly bears, wolves, elk, and bighorn sheep), maintaining healthy 
              populations and mitigating human-wildlife conflicts is of utmost importance to us. </p>

            <p>The best way to discover what Banff means to you is to come see for yourself! If you feel that Banff means something 
              to you, we would greatly appreciate your support:</p>
